### Module 3


## Introduction to DA Methodology and bivariate data analysis

##### In this module you will learn the fundamental concepts of statistical modelling, starting with exploring the data by using appropriate plots and computation of descriptive statistics, and moving on to inferential statistics of parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. You will learn how to match up data types with an appropriate statistical model with the focus on the ‘Measured vs Attribute’ and ‘Measured vs Measured’ types of a bivariate data analysis problem. With the knowledge from this lesson you will be able to conduct basic ‘MvA’ and ‘MvM’ types of statistical analysis, interpret and report its outcomes in an appropriate manner.

#### What you will learn:

* The concept of statistical distribution
* Exploring different data types
* Common data-analysis methodology; hypothesis testing
* To investigate relationships between M and A variables
  - Two tail t-test
  - One-way ANOVA
* To investigate relationships between two M variables
  - Simple linear regression
