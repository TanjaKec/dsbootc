### About the Course

##### Data literacy is an essential part of a data-driven culture. In this course we will teach you to â€˜master and speak dataâ€™ by taking a step by step approach from the beginning to identify unseen details and to produce visual data stories and data predictions. You will learn the basics of descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, statistical tests as well as machine learning techniques. 

##### The content of the course is designed to inform, motivate and equip you to use data as part of your everyday language, empowering you and making you more productive in your daily work.

##### At the end of the course, participants will be able to quickly find and implement appropriate analytical methods to answer their own data-related questions. 

* Learn to explore, visualise, and analyse data in a reproducible and shareable manner 
* Develop an understanding and basic knowledge to model data, to identify patterns and make predictions
* Develop an understanding of the most commonly used analytical techniques practised in industry today
* Work on case studies inspired by real problems and based on real-world data
* Become aware and recognise the huge potential for data science

#### then this course is for you! ðŸ˜€

#### You should have access to a laptop.

#### Acknowledgement

>##### During my lecturing career I was incredibly fortunate to work with some truly amazing colleagues who have helped me explore and develop my own teaching philosophy and practice. I gained valuable experience in developing, designing and teaching data analysis modules at varying levels of undergraduate and graduate courses. In particular I mastered my teaching skills by lecturing with George Rawlings and Ian McGowan on decision modelling modules. They taught me how to teach basic statistical concepts, which theoretically may be perceived as complex, in an effective way by emphasising concepts over formulas, engaging students to reason rather than to memorise.

>##### The material presented is built on those principles and been enriched by integrating   the vast amount of open and inclusive #rstats community resources. This learning resource is free to use. It is written in [`Rmarkdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rmarkdown/index.html) using [`blogdown`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html) package.
